# Transliterations of the original Wenker-survey

## Georg Wenker's survey of German dialects

[some background on the data]

## Transliterations

Different projects have provided transliterations. An ongoing effort is <https://wenker.online.uni-marburg.de/wenker/>

## Format

The texts provided here try to remain as close as possible to the original hand-written survey responses. An attempt has been made to harmonize the diacritis as much as possible, while retaining the idiosyncracies of the originals.

Note the following uses of brackets:

- Parts that are difficult to decipher are indicated by square brackets **`[ ]`**. For any further processing of the texts these brackets should be removed. However, sometimes these parts are not legible at all, and then a questionmark is inserted between the square brackets, ideally one questionmark for each non-legible character of the original, e.g. **`[??]`**. Such characters have to be treated as not-available data.
- Commentary inserted into the text by the original respondent is marked by angled brackets **`< >`**. To retain a verbatim transliteration of the original response, only these brackets have to be removed. To obtain the pure text without commentary, everything inside these brackets has to be removed as well.
- Commentary inserted in the process of digitization is marked by curly brackets **`{ }`**. For most uses of these text these brackets and everything in between should probably simply be removed.
